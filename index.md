## About me 

- I am a third-year master's degree student, pursuing MSc in Information Engineering, advised by [Dr. Yingming Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations user=iJSQam8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), and [Prof. Zhongfei (Mark) Zhang](http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~zhongfei/). 
I have obtained a bachelor's degree of the same specialisation at Zhejiang University.
- My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning, as well as their applications in multi-task learning and meta-learning. I am looking for a PhD position in the cross-field research of machine-learning.
